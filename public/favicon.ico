The favicon.ico file is typically a binary file that represents the icon for the website. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as `favicon.ico` in the specified directory.

You can create a favicon using online tools or design software, and then place the resulting file in the `public` directory of your project.
